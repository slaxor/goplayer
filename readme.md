A currently simple (Go|Baduk|WeiXi|Igo) player
==============================================

Features:
---------
 *   Right now it can load sgf-files from dgs ("/dgs/:gameId")
 *   Show them to you via the - great and free -  ["eidogo player"](http://eidogo.com/)

It is written in node.js using express.js and is a playground for me to try different approaches with node.

You can use it the usual way with:

    git clone https://github.com/slaxor/goplayer.git
    cd goplayer
    npm install
    node app

Lets see how it goesâ€¦
